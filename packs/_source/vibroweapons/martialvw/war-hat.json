If you do so, you gain the same bonus to AC. These effects last until the start of your next turn, as long as you're holding the weapon.</p>\n<h3>Disguised</h3>\n<p>You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to hide the nature of a weapon with this property.</p>\n<h3>Returning </h3>\n<p>When you throw a weapon with this property, it automatically returns to your hand after the attack is complete, whether you hit or miss.</p>\n<h3>Thrown (range 30/90)</h3>\n<p>A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has this property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</p>"
