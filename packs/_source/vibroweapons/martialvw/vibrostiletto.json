You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</p>\n<h3>Keen 1</h3>\n<p>When you make a weapon attack with a weapon with the keen property, the critical hit range increases by an amount equal to the keen number.</p>\n<h3>Light</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when engaging in Double- or Two-Weapon Fighting. See the rules for Double- and Two-Weapon Fighting in chapter 9.</p>\n<h3>Thrown (range 30/90)</h3>\n<p>A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has this property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</p>"
