          "value": "<h3>Disarming</h3>\n<p>When you score a critical hit with a weapon with the disarming property against a creature that is holding an object, you can attempt to disarm the target (no action required). If the target is no more than one size larger than you (your size or smaller if your weapon has the light property), it must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon) or it drops an object of your choice at its feet.</p>\n<h3>Disguised</h3>\n<p>You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to hide the nature of a weapon with this property.</p>\n<h3>Finesse</h3>\n<p>When making an attack with a weapon with this property, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</p>\n<h3>Light</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when engaging in Double- or Two-Weapon Fighting. See the rules for Double- and Two-Weapon Fighting in chapter 9.</p>"
