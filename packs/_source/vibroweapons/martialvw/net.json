          "value": "<h3>Light</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when engaging in Double- or Two-Weapon Fighting. See the rules for Double- and Two-Weapon Fighting in chapter 9.</p>\n<h3>Finesse</h3>\n<p>When making an attack with a weapon with this property, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</p>\n<h3>Thrown (range 15)</h3>\n<p>A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has this property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</p>\n<h3>Special</h3>\n<p>A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on formless or Huge or larger creatures. A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has an AC of 10, 5 hit points, and immunity to all damage not dealt by melee weapons. Destroying the net frees the creature without harming it and immediately ends the net's effects. While a creature is restrained by a net, you can make no further attacks with it.</p>"
