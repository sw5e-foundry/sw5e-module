  description:
    value: <p>As an action, your ship can create a cloud of icy fog in a 200-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 1200 feet. The sphere extends around objects, and its area is heavily obscured. The fog is semi-solid, and its area is considered difficult terrain. Each ship that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 4d6 cold damage and gains 1 slowed level until the end of its turn. The fog lasts for one minute or until it's dispersed.</p><p>This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.</p>
