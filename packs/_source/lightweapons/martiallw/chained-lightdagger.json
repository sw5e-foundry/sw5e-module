You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</p>\n<h3>Luminous</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius while activated. Additionally, Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while the weapon is activated have disadvantage.</p>\n<h3>Reach</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property adds 5 feet to your reach with it.</p>"
