A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with Double-Weapon Fighting. See the rules for Double-Weapon Fighting in chapter 9.</p>\n<h3>Interlocking</h3>\n<p>While wielding a weapon with the interlocking property, you can use your object interaction to detach the weapon into two separate weapons or reattach into a single weapon. While separated, each weapon has the same damage, damage type, combined value and weight, and properties (except for the double property) as the single weapon.</p>\n<h3>Light</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when engaging in Double- or Two-Weapon Fighting. See the rules for Double- and Two-Weapon Fighting in chapter 9.</p>\n<h3>Luminous</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius while activated. Additionally, Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while the weapon is activated have disadvantage.</p>"
