If you do so, you gain the same bonus to AC. These effects last until the start of your next turn, as long as you're holding the weapon.</p>\n<h3>Dexterity 13</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property requires more skill to control. While wielding it, you have disadvantage on attack rolls unless you meet the Dexterity requirement. </p>\n<h3>Heavy</h3>\n<p>When you hit with an attack roll using Strength with a weapon with this property, you deal additional damage equal to half your Strength modifier (minimum of +1).</p>\n<h3>Luminous</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius while activated. Additionally, Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while the weapon is activated have disadvantage.</p>\n<h3>Versatile ([[/r 1d10]])</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.\t</p>"
