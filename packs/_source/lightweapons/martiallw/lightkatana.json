While wielding it, you have disadvantage on attack rolls unless you meet the Dexterity requirement. </p>\n<h3>Hidden</h3>\n<p>You have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks made to conceal a weapon with this property.</p>\n<h3>Luminous</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius while activated. Additionally, Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while the weapon is activated have disadvantage.</p>\n<h3>Piercing 1</h3>\n<p>Before you make a weapon attack with a weapon with the piercing property, you can choose to gain a bonus to the attack roll up to the piercing number. If you do so and you hit with it, you suffer an equivalent penalty to the damage roll.</p>\n<h3>Versatile ([[/r 1d10]])</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.\t</p>"
