Additionally, Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while the weapon is activated have disadvantage.</p>\n<h3>Returning </h3>\n<p>When you throw a weapon with this property, it automatically returns to your hand after the attack is complete, whether you hit or miss.</p>\n<h3>Thrown (range 25/75)</h3>\n<p>A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has this property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range.
