Additionally, you have a +10 bonus to ability checks and saving throws to avoid being disarmed of this weapon.</p>\n<h3>Light</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when engaging in Double- or Two-Weapon Fighting. See the rules for Double- and Two-Weapon Fighting in chapter 9.</p>\n<h3>Luminous</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius while activated.
