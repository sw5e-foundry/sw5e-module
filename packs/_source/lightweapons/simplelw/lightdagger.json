See the rules for Double- and Two-Weapon Fighting in chapter 9.</p>\n<h3>Luminous</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius while activated. Additionally, Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while the weapon is activated have disadvantage.</p>\n<h3>Thrown (range 20/60)</h3>\n<p>A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has this property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</p>"
