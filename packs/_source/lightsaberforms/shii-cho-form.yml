      <p>As a part of the bonus action to adopt this form, if you took the Attack action, you can engage in Double- or Two-Weapon Fighting.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the first time you hit a Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of you with a weapon attack before the end of your next turn, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon). On a failed save, it is pushed back 5 feet, and you can immediately move into the space it just vacated without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>
