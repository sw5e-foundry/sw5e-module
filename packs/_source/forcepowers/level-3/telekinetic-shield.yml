      <p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Animate Weapon</em></p>
      <p>You lift three piles of debris or small objects from the ground and interpose them between you and your opponents for the duration. </p>
      <p>While at least three piles remain, you have three-quarters cover. While two piles remain, you have half cover. While only one pile remains, you have one-quarter cover. The piles don't hinder your attacks. When you cast the power, or as an action on a subsequent turn, you can direct up to two piles to attack up to two creatures you can see within 30 feet. Make a ranged force attack roll for each pile. On a hit, a creature takes [[/r 2d6]] kinetic plus [[/r 1d10]] force damage. The pile is destroyed whether it hits or misses.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Force Potency.</em></strong> If you cast this power with a force slot of 4th level or higher, the power creates one additional pile for each level above 3rd. </p>
