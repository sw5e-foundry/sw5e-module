The ground where a pillar appears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you can target the ground under a creature if that creature is Medium or smaller. Each pillar has AC 5 and 30 hit points.

The restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (the creature's choice) against the power's save DC.
