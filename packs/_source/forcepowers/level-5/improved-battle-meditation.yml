      <p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Battle Meditation</em></p>
      <p>You exude an aura out to 15 feet that boosts the morale and overall battle prowess you and your allies while simultaneously reducing the opposition's combat-effectiveness by eroding their will to fight. </p>
      <p>Whenever you or a friendly creature within your meditation makes an attack roll or a saving throw, they can roll a [[/r d6]] and add the number rolled to the attack roll or saving throw. </p>
      <p>Whenever a hostile creature enters your meditation or starts its turn there, it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it must roll a [[/r d6]] and subtract the number rolled from each attack roll or saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn. On a successful save, it is immune to this power for 1 day.</p>
