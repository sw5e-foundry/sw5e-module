      <p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Horror</em></p>
      <p>This power assaults and twists creatures' minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this power or be affected by it.</p>
      <p>An affected target can't take reactions and must roll a [[/r d8]] at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn. This power has no effect on constructs or droids.</p>
      <p>|[[/r d8]]|Behavior|</p>
      <p>|:--:|:--|</p>
      <p>|1| The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a [[/r d8]] and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn't take an action this turn.|</p>
      <p>|2-6| The creature doesn't move or take actions this turn.|</p>
      <p>|7-8|The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.|</p>
      <p>At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Force Potency.</em></strong> When you cast this power using a power slot of 6th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each force slot level above 5th.</p>
