      <p>One humanoid of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. The </p>
      <p>charmed target must use its action before moving on each of its turns to make a melee attack against a creature other than itself that you mentally choose.</p>
      <p>The target can act normally on its turn if you choose no creature or if none are within its reach.</p>
      <p>On your subsequent turns, you must use your action to maintain control over the target, or the power ends. Also, the target can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the power ends.</p>
