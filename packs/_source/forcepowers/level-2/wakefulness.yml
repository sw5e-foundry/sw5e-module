      <p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Breath Control</em></p>
      <p>You use the Force to control your body's functions. For the duration, you gain the following benefits:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>You ignore the effects of any levels of exhaustion you have. </li>
      <li>You do not need to eat, drink, or sleep. You can't be forced to sleep by any means. To gain the benefits of a long rest, you can spend all 8 hours doing light activity, such as reading and keeping watch. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you still have any levels of exhaustion when this power ends, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you gain one additional level of exhaustion.</p>
