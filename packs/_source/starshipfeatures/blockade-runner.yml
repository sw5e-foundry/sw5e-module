  description:
    value: <p>Also at 1st tier, your starship gains the ability to react to damage from large ships.</p><p>As a reaction to being hit with an attack roll from a Large or larger ship, a crewmember at the helm can use their reaction to immediately move the ship forward an amount equal to half its flying speed (rounded down) and then roll a Blockade Runner die, which is a [[/r 1d4]], and subtract it from the triggering attack roll, potentially causing it to miss.</p><p>Your ship's Blockade Runner die changes when it reaches certain tiers. The die becomes a [[/r 1d6]] at 2nd tier, a [[/r 1d8]] at 3rd tier, a [[/r 1d10]] at 4th tier, and a [[/r 1d12]] at 5th tier.</p><p>This feature can be used a number of times equal to 3 x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship is refitted.</p>
