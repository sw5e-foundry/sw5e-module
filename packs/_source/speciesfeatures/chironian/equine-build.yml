  description:
    value: <p>Your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift doubles. If it would already double, it instead triples. Additionally, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your hooves. When you make such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 4 extra feet, instead of the normal 1 extra foot. Finally, a Medium or smaller creature can ride on your equine back if you allow it. In such a situation, you continue to act independently, not as a controlled mount.</p>
