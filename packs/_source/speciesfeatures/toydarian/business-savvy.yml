  description:
    value: <p>A common trait of all Toydarians is their shrewd business sense and their ability to haggle any deal. A loyal and proud people, these traits could be off-putting to outsiders, as many Toydarians in the galaxy were seen as crooks or slimy businessmen, but this was not always the case. Whenever you make a Charisma (Persuasion) check involving haggling you are considered to have expertise in the Persuasion skill.</p>
