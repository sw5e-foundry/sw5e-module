      "value": "<p>As an action, while touching a creature, you can initiate a memnii transfer. The creature must make an Intelligence saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier), a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. On a failed save the target is stunned, and you can share vivid memories with the target as if they were their own for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a power). The transfer ends if you stop touching the target. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can repeat the saving throw to resist the transfer. On a success, the transfer ends. Otherwise, you may end the transfer on your turn (no action required). Once you've used this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. This feature has no effect on droids, constructs, or Force-Insensitive creatures.</p>",
