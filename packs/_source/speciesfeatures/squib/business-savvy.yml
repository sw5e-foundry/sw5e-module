    value: <p>A common trait of all Squibs is their desire and love of haggling. Squibs believe a deal is done when both sides believe they got the better of the other. Whenever you make a Charisma (Persuasion) check involving haggling you are considered to have expertise in the Persuasion skill.</p>
