      "value": "<p>Your claws are a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Additionally, your unarmed strikes deal [[/r 1d4]] kinetic damage and have the finesse property. Lastly, as a bonus action, you can perform a special claw attack. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, the target is poisoned until the end of its next turn, and you can't use this feature again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>",
