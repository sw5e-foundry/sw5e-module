    value: <p>You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Huttese. Hutts rarely speak Galactic Basic, even though they are perfectly able; if the person with whom they are speaking doesn't understand Huttese, they are more likely to use an interpretor than deign to speak the language of lesser species.</p>
