      <p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> River of Hungry Flame</em></p>
      <p>As an action, you cause flames to race across your body, granting the following benefits until the start of your next turn:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>You have resistance to fire damage.</li>
      <li>The flames shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.</li>
      <li>Any creature that moves within 5 feet of you for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there takes [[/r 1d10]] fire damage.</li>
      <li>You can use your action to create a line of fire 15 feet long and 5 feet wide extending from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking [[/r 4d8]] fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>At the start of each of your turns, you can use your bonus action to extend the benefits of this feature until the start of your next turn, to a maximum duration of 1 minute. This effect ends immediately if you are incapacitated or die.</p>
