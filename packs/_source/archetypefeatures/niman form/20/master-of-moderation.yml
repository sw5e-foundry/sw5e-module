      <p><em><strong>Niman Form:</strong> 20th level</em></p>
      <p>The Force flows in perfect concert with your weapon attacks. Your Dexterity and Wisdom or Charisma scores (your choice) increase by 2. Your maximum for these scores increases by 2. Additionally, you can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>You have resistance to kinetic and energy damage from unenhanced weapons.</li>
      <li>You have advantage on saving throws against force powers. Additionally, you have resistance against the damage of force powers.</li>
      <li>When you use your action to cast an at-will force power that targets only one creature, you can target an additional creature within 5 feet of the original target and within the power's range.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
