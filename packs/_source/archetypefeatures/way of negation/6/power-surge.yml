      <p><em><strong>Way of Negation:</strong> 6th level</em></p>
      <p>You learn to simultaneously limit a creature's force powers and store that power within yourself to later strengthen your damaging force powers.</p>
      <p>You can store a maximum number of power surges equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). Whenever you successfully end a force power with a power such as <em>force suppression</em> or <em>sever force</em>, or use your Force Shield or Force Deflection features to successfully avoid an attack or succeed on a saving throw, you gain one power surge, as you redirect the flow of the Force into yourself. </p>
      <p>Once per turn, when you deal damage to a creature or object with a force power, you can spend one power surge to deal extra damage to that target. The extra damage is of the same type as the power's damage, and it equals half your consular level.</p>
      <p>Whenever you finish a long rest, your number of power surges resets to one. If you end a short rest with no power surges, you gain one power surge.</p>
