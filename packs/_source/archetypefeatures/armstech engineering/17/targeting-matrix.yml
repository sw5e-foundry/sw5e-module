      <p><em><strong>Armstech Engineering:</strong> 14th and 17th level</em></p>
      <p>When you cast a tech power that allows you to force creatures in an area to make a saving throw, you can instead make an attack roll with your modified weapon against a single target that would be in the range of the power. On a hit, the target suffers the effects as though they failed their saving throw. If the power would affect more than one creature, it instead affects only one.</p>
      <p>You can use this feature five times. You gain an additional use at 17th level. You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
