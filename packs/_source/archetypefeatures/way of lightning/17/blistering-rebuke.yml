      <p><em><strong>Way of Lightning:</strong> 10th, 13th, and 17th level</em></p>
      <p>When a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to cause the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes [[/r 1d10]] plus your consular level lightning damage, is pushed back 10 feet, and becomes <em>shocked</em> until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't moved or <em>shocked</em>.</p>
      <p>You can use this feature four times. You gain an additional use at 13th and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
