      <p><em><strong>Whills Order:</strong> 6th level</em></p>
      <p>As you channel the Force through you, you gain the following benefits:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>You can use your Stunning Strike feature when you hit with a ranged weapon attack while you are wielding a Whills weapon. </li>
      <li>You can spend up to 3 focus points to reduce partial cover by one step (from three-quarters to half or half to one-quarter). If you reduce the target below one-quarter cover, you ignore cover bonuses entirely. At 17th level, you can spend 3 focus points to ignore total cover, as long as your target is not hidden from you. </li>
      <li>When you hit a creature with a Whills weapon, that creature has disadvantage on opportunity attacks against you until the start of your next turn.</li></ul>
