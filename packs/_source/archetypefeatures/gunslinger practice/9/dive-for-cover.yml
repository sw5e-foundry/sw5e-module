      <p><em><strong>Gunslinger Practice:</strong> 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level</em></p>
      <p>You learn to quickly move into cover when under fire. Once per round, when you are the target of a ranged attack, or you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw, and there is cover within 10 feet of you, you can move up to 10 feet (no action required). You must end this movement in cover.</p>
      <p>You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>
