      <p>Once per turn, when your companion is within 10 feet of you and it hits a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force and expend force points to have your companion deal additional damage to the target, which is the same type as the weapon's damage. The additional damage is [[/r 1d8]] for each point spent in this way. You can't deal more additional damage than the amount shown in the Focused Strikes column of the guardian table.</p>
      <p>At 11th level, your companion must be within 30 feet of you to benefit from this feature. At 17th level, your companion must be within 60 feet.</p>
