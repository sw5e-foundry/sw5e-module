      <p><em><strong>Artillerist Technique:</strong> 15th level</em></p>
      <p>You can now expend two uses of your Modular Munitions feature when you cast a tech power to apply two empowerment effects, instead of only one. Additionally, you gain three additional empowerment effects:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Confusion</strong>: Each creature damaged by this power must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, on its next turn, a creature must use its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.</li>
      <li><strong>Knockout</strong>: Each creature damaged by this power must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</li>
      <li><strong>Static</strong>: Each creature damaged by this power must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or become shocked until the start of your next turn.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additionally, when you would spend 1 tech point to apply an empowerment effect, it no longer reduces your maximum tech points.</p>
