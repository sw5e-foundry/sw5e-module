      <p><em><strong>Ruffian Practice:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>
      <p>You learn to fluidly strike and maneuver through combat. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack Dice in order to maneuver across the battlefield.</p>
      <p>Some of your fancy footworks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the debilitating strike's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: </p>
      <p><em></em>_</p>
      <p><strong>Nimble Step save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier.</p>
      <p><em></em>_</p>
      <h3>@UUID[Compendium.sw5e.archetypefeatures.Item.od16cTmbcCNjRtn3]{Blade Defense}</h3>
      <p>You attempt to determine your target's next strike. Roll two Sneak Attack dice, and the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, your AC increases by the higher amount rolled on the dice against the first attack it makes against you before the start of your next turn. On a successful save, your AC instead increases by the lower amount.</p>
      <h3>@UUID[Compendium.sw5e.archetypefeatures.Item.cB9pV0vAvbiXq35w]{Disarming Strike}</h3>
      <p>You attempt to disarm a creature with your attack. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be forced to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. If you have a free hand, you can catch the item. Otherwise, it lands at your feet.</p>
      <h3>@UUID[Compendium.sw5e.archetypefeatures.Item.9bNPNvyMPmqckMHF]{Fancy Footwork}</h3>
      <p>Roll two Sneak Attack dice. Your speed increases by 5 x the greater result of the two dice, and you ignore difficult terrain until the end of your current turn.</p>
