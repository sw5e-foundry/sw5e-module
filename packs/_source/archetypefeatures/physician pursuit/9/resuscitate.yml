      <p><em><strong>Physician Pursuit:</strong> 9th level</em></p>
      <p>Through your medical studies you have learned to delay seemingly inevitable death. As a bonus action, you can stabilize a creature you can touch that has 0 hit points. </p>
      <p>Additionally, as an action, you can tend to a creature you can touch that has died since the end of your last turn. The creature immediately regains 1 hit point and stabilizes. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>
