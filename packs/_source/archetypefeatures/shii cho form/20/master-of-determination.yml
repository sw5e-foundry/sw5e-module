      <p><em><strong>Shii-Cho Form:</strong> 20th level</em></p>
      <p>The erratic fluidity of your movement confounds even the most determined of foes. Your Strength or Dexterity and Wisdom or Charisma scores (your choice) increase by 2. Your maximum for these scores increases by 2. Additionally, you can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>You have resistance to kinetic, energy, and ion damage from weapons.</li>
      <li>Attack rolls made against you can't have advantage.</li>
      <li>When more than one creature is within 5 feet of you, you gain a bonus to your Armor Class equal to the number of creatures within 5 feet of you, up to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one).</li>
      <li>When you use your Sarlaac Sweep feature, you have advantage on the attack roll, and you can apply the bonus damage to every creature within 5 feet of you.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
