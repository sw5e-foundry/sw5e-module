      <p>You convert raw materials into products of the same material.</p>
      <p>For example, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a patch of hemp, and clothes from bantha hide.</p>
      <p>Choose raw materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes), given a sufficient quantity of raw material. If you are working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a single 5-foot cube). The quality of objects made by the power is commensurate with the quality of the raw materials.</p>
      <p>Creatures or enhanced items can't be created by this power. You also can't use it to create items that ordinarily require a high degree of craftsmanship, such as jewelry, weapons, glass, or armor, unless you have proficiency with the type of tool used to craft such objects.</p>
