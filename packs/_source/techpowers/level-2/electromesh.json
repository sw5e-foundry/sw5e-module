      "value": "<p>You expel a mass of thick, adhesive mesh at a point of your choice within range. The mesh fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The mesh is difficult terrain and lightly obscures their area.</p>\n<p>If the mesh isn't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the electromesh collapses on itself, and the power ends at the start of your next turn. Mesh layered over a flat surface has a depth of 5 feet.</p>\n<p>Each creature that starts its turn in the mesh or that enters it during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the mesh or until it breaks free.</p>\n<p>A creature restrained by the mesh can use its action to make a Strength check against your tech save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.</p>\n<p>The mesh is flammable. Any 5-foot cube of electromesh exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing [[/r 2d4]] fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.</p>",
