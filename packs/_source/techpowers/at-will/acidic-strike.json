Until the start of your next turn, if the target becomes grappled, or succeeds in grappling or maintaining a grapple, the slime is pressed into its body, causing it to immediately take [[/r 1d8]] acid damage. </p>\n<p>This power's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra [[/r 1d8]] acid damage to the target, and the damage the target takes for taking grappling or maintaining a grapple increases to [[/r 2d8]].
