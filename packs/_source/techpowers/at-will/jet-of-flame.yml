      <p>A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The power ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.</p>
      <p>You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the power. When you cast this power, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged tech attack. On a hit, the target takes [[/r 1d8]] fire damage. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.</p>
      <p>This power's damage increases by [[/r 1d8]] when you reach 5th level ([[/r 2d8]]), 11th level ([[/r 3d8]]), and 17th level ([[/r 4d8]]).</p>
