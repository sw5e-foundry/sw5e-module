      <p>As part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a ranged weapon attack against one creature within your weapon's range, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and it becomes ignited (your techcasting ability modifier). </p>
      <p>This power's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the ranged attack deals an extra [[/r 1d6]] fire damage to the target, and the ignited damage increases to [[/r 1d4]] + your tech casting ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by [[/r 1d6]] and [[/r 1d4]], respectively, at 11th level and 17th level.</p>
