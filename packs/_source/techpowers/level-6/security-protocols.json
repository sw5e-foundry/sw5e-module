      "value": "<p>You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The secured area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the power.</p>\n<p>When you cast this power, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.</p>\n<p>When commanded (no action required), <em>security protocols</em> creates the following effects within the secured area.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Corridors.</em></strong> Fog fills all the secured corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Doors.</em></strong> All doors in the secured area are locked, as if sealed by the <em>lock</em> power. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an image (equivalent to the illusory object function of the <em>minor hologram</em> power) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Stairs.</em></strong> Electromesh fills all stairs in the secured area from top to bottom, as the <em>electromesh</em> power. This mesh regrows in 10 minutes if it is burned or torn away while <em>security protocols</em> lasts.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Other power effect.</em></strong> You can place your choice of one of the following enhanced effects within the secured area of the stronghold.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Place <em>mobile lights</em> in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as <em>security protocols</em> lasts.</li>\n<li>Place <em>implant message</em> in two locations.</li>\n<li>Place <em>debilitating gas</em> in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while <em>security protocols</em> lasts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The whole secured area radiates power. A <em>diminish tech</em> cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.</p>\n<p>You can create a permanently guarded and secured structure by casting this power there every day for one year.</p>",
