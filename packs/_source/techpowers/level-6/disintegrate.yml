      <p>A blast of corrosive energy emits from you. Choose a target within range. </p>
      <p>A creature targeted by this power must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes [[/r 10d6 + 40]] acid damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.</p>
      <p>A disintegrated creature and everything unenhanced it is wearing or carrying are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. A creature destroyed in this way can not be revitalized.</p>
      <p>This power automatically disintegrates an unenhanced Large or smaller object. If the target is a Huge or larger object, this power disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. </p>
      <p><strong><em>Overcharge Tech.</em></strong> When you cast this power using a tech slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by [[/r 3d6]] for each slot level above 6th.</p>
