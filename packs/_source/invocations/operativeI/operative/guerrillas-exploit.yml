    value: <p>You only need 3 hours of sleep during a long rest to gain its benefits, instead of 6. Additionally, if your long rest would be interrupted, you only need to complete the long rest instead of restarting it to gain its benefits. Lastly, you have advantage on saving throws against exhaustion.</p>
