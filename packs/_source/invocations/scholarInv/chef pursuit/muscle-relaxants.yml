  description:
    value: <p>As a bonus action while preparing or touching food, you may expend a superiority die and add to it a fast acting muscle relaxant. At the start of each of its turns, a creature that consumes this food must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it subtracts the result of your superiority die from the first damage roll it makes before the start of its next turn. The effect of this maneuver ends when the creature completes its next long rest or 24 hours have passed. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>
