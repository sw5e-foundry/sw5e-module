      "value": "<p>At the end of a short or long rest you may expend a superiority die and choose a number of friendly creatures up to your maneuver modifier (minimum of one), if they ate food you prepared. Each creature gains a number of temporary force or tech points (their choice) equal to the number you roll on the superiority die. When an affected creature casts a force or tech power, the temporary force or tech points are spent first. An affected target can only benefit from one source of temporary force or tech points at a time, and they last until they're depleted or until the affected target completes their next short or long rest. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>",
