Creatures that consume it are considered adapted to hot climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, until the end of the creature's next long rest or 24 hours have passed. Additionally, the first time a creature who eats your food takes fire damage before the end of their next short or long rest, they are considered resistant to the damage.</p>",
