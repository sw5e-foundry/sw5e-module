    value: <p>You sprout a pair of winged arms. You gain a flying speed equal to half your walking speed. You can only gain the benefit of items held by two of your arms at any given time, and once per round you can switch which arms you are benefiting from (no action required). When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, your flying speed increases to your full walking speed, and you can use your bonus action to take the Dash action for the duration.</p>
