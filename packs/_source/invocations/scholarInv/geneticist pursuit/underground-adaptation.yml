  description:
    value: <p>You gain a burrowing speed equal to your walking speed and you can tunnel through solid rock at a rate of 1 foot per round. In order to use this speed, you must have two free hands. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, you gain tremorsense out to 30 feet for the duration. You can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can't be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures.</p>
