  description:
    value: <p>At the end of a long rest, you can choose one creature you can see within 30 feet (this includes you) to imbue with unnatural power. The creature's hit point maximum and current hit points increase by an amount equal to your scholar level, and it has advantage on Constitution saving throws made to avoid exhaustion. Both effects end after 8 hours.</p>
