When you make a high jump, you can leap a number of feet up into the air equal to 3 + twice your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice).</p>\n<p>Additionally, as a bonus action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy. For the next minute, opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.</p>",
