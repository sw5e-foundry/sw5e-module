      <p>You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the fighting style options, detailed in Chapter 6. </p>
      <p>Additionally, as a bonus action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy. For the next minute, you know the fighting mastery that corresponds with the fighting style you chose with this feature. If you already know that fighting mastery, you instead learn another of your choice for the duration.</p>
