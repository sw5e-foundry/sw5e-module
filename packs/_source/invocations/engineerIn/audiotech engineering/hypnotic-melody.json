Choose a number of creature up to your Intelligence modifier. If those creatures listen to this song for a full minute, they must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for 1 minute. Creatures that succeed the saving throw are not aware that you attempted to influence them, nor are creatures that failed their saving throw once the power ends.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
