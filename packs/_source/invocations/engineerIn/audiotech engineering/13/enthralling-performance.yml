      <p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 13th level, Hypnotic Melody</em></p>
      <p>For the duration of an enhanced song you play, whenever any creature that can hear your song tries to attack you for the first time on a turn, the attacker must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it can't attack you on this turn, and it must choose a new target for its attack or the attack is wasted. On a successful save, it can attack you on this turn, but it has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against your powers or features on your next turn.</p>
      <p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.</p>
