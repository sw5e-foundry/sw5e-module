      <p>When you are holding your modified instrument, and not actively playing a song, any tech power that you could cast that could have its damage type altered by your Potent Amplitude feature can be cast as if used with Potent Amplitude. </p>
      <p>You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>
