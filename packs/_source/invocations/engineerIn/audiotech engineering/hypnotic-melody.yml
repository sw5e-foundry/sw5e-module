      <p>As an action while wielding your modified instrument, you can begin to play a song woven with subtle hypnotic influence. Choose a number of creature up to your Intelligence modifier. If those creatures listen to this song for a full minute, they must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for 1 minute. Creatures that succeed the saving throw are not aware that you attempted to influence them, nor are creatures that failed their saving throw once the power ends.</p>
      <p>Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
