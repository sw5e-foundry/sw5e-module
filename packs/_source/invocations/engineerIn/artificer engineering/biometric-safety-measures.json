      "value": "<p>A security system is installed into the hilt of your lightweapon. When a creature other than you attempts to activate your lightweapon, the activation fails. Additionally, the creature attempting to activate must make on a Constitution saving throw or take lightning damage equal to engineer level, and become shocked until the start of its next turn. On a successful save the creature takes half damage and is not shocked. Regardless of success or failure, the creature drops your modified lightsaber.</p>",
