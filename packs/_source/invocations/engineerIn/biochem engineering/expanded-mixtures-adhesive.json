      "value": "<p>You've created a new mixture from your chemicals that you can use when you activate your distributor. When you do so, the target creature must make a Strength saving throw. If the creature is Large or larger, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, a creature gains 4 slowed levels until the start of your next turn. As an action on their turn, an affected creature can repeat this saving throw, ending the effect on a success. </p>",
