      <p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 7th level</em></p>
      <p>Whenever you use your Biochemist's Touch feature, you may select one creature that was damaged. At the start of each of that creature's turns, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes damage of the triggering type equal to your Intelligence modifier and has disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of its next turn. On a success, this feature ends, and the creature becomes immune to it for one day.</p>
      <p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>
