If it dies, you can't use it again until you complete a long rest. As an action on each of your turns, you can control the hand as long as it is within 30 feet of you. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a container. You can move the hand up to its speed each time you use it.</p>\n<p>You can choose this modification multiple times.</p>",
