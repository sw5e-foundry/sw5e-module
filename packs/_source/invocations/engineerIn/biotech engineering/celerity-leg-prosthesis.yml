      <p>This augmentation replaces both legs.</p>
      <p>When determining your bonus to AC and saving throws from Dexterity, your Dexterity score is treated as 15. If your Dexterity score is already equal to or greater than 15, it has no effect on you.</p>
      <p>Additionally, you can substitute this score for your own whenever you make an ability check or attack roll that uses your legs. </p>
