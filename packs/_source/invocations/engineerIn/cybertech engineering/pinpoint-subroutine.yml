      <p>When you cast a power that allows you to force creatures in an area to make a saving throw you can instead spend 1 tech point and make a ranged tech attack against a single target that would be in the range. On a hit the target suffers the effects as though they failed their saving throw. </p>
      <p>You can use only one Subroutine modification on a power when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.</p>
