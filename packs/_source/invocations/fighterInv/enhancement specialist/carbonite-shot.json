      "value": "<p>When this shot strikes its target, shards of carbonite wrap around the target. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra [[/r 2d6]] cold damage, it gains 1 slowed level, and it takes [[/r 2d6]] kinetic damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the carbonite with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Special Ammunition save DC. Otherwise, the carbonite lasts for 1 minute or until you use this option again.</p>\n<p>The cold damage and kinetic damage both increase to [[/r 4d6]] when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>",
