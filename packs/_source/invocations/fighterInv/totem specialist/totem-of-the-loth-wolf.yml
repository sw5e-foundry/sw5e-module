      <p>This totem emulates the near etherealness of a loth-wolf, granting you advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and Charisma (Deception) checks.</p>
      <p>Additionally, when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to invoke the totem and cause that attack to target a different creature within 30 feet of you (other than the attacker) that you can see, using the same roll. This ability can transfer the attack regardless of the attack's range. </p>
