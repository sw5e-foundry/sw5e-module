      <p><em><strong>Scout:</strong> 2nd level</em></p>
      <p>You have derived powers from schematics with the aid of your wristpad. See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.</p>
      <h3>@UUID[Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.Item.WEd0fQVWnJa69R86]{Tech Powers Known}</h3>
      <p>You learn 4 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the scout table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.</p>
      <h3>@UUID[Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.Item.IgFCulwV0ckZjbfC]{Tech Points}</h3>
      <p>You have a number of tech points equal to your scout level, as shown in the Tech Points column of the scout table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
      <h3>@UUID[Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.Item.KruXHvFJMIjA4SfB]{Max Power Level}</h3>
      <p>Many tech powers can be overcharged, consuming </p>
      <p>more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the scout table.</p>
      <p>You may only cast tech powers at 4th and 5th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.</p>
      <h3>@UUID[Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.Item.wAlSP0R3X7TNF5Qp]{Techcasting Ability}</h3>
      <p>Intelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. Additionally, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
      <p><em></em>_</p>
      <p><strong>Tech save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
      <p><em></em>_</p>
      <p><strong>Tech attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
      <p><em></em>_</p>
      <h3>@UUID[Compendium.sw5e.classfeatures.Item.xK7ptD2pk8iqKQQh]{Techcasting Focus}</h3>
      <p>You use a wristpad (found in chapter 5) as a tech focus for your tech powers.</p>
