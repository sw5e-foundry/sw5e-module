A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (their choice). You must have one free hand to reload.</p>\n<h3>Special (range special)</h3>\n<p>A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has this property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</p>\n<h3>Strength 13</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property has a heavy kickback. While wielding it, you have disadvantage on attack rolls unless you meet the Strength requirement. If the weapon has the burst, penetrating, or rapid property, you must meet the Strength requirement to use this feature. If the weapon lacks the two-handed property, you can wield the weapon in two hands to temporarily reduce the strength number by one step (from 19 to 17, 17 to 15, 15 to 13, or 13 to 11). If this would reduce the strength number below 11, you ignore it entirely.</p>\n<h3>Two-handed</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property requires two hands to use.</p><h3>Description</h3>\n<p>The flechette cannon does not make attack rolls. Rather than traditional power cells, the flechette cannon uses specialized projector tanks, which, when fired, spray an area with the contents of the tank. Projector tanks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the tank—s effects. It can have different ammunition types loaded simultaneously, and you can choose which ammunition you—re using as you fire it (no action required). If you don—t meet the flechette cannon—s strength requirement, creatures have advantage on their saving throws. If you lack proficiency in the flechette cannon, you must roll the damage dice twice and take the lesser total.</p>",
