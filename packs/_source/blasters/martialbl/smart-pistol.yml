      <h3>Piercing 1</h3>
      <p>Before you make a weapon attack with a weapon with the piercing property, you can choose to gain a bonus to the attack roll up to the piercing number. If you do so and you hit with it, you suffer an equivalent penalty to the damage roll.</p>
      <h3>Rapid 2</h3>
      <p>When you would make a ranged weapon attack with a weapon with this property, you can instead unload on a single target, consuming ammunition equal to the rapid number. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon). On a failed save, roll the weapon's damage dice twice and add them together, adding relevant modifiers as normal and subjecting the target to any additional effects that would occur on a hit. If you would have advantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has disadvantage on their saving throw, and if you would have disadvantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has advantage on their saving throw.</p>
      <h3>Reload 16</h3>
      <p>A number of shots equal to the reload number can be made with a weapon with this property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (their choice). You must have one free hand to reload.</p>
      <h3>Slug cartridge (range 40/160)</h3>
      <p>A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has this property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</p>
      <h3>Smart (15/+2)</h3>
      <p>This weapon ignores your Dexterity score and proficiency bonus. Two numbers appear in parentheses with the propertyâ€”the first is the weapon's Dexterity score, and the second is the weapon's proficiency bonus. The weapon uses these values instead of yours when you make attack and damage rolls with it. If you lack proficiency with the weapon, the weapon does not benefit from its proficiency bonus.</p>
      <h3>Strength 11</h3>
      <p>A weapon with this property has a heavy kickback. While wielding it, you have disadvantage on attack rolls unless you meet the Strength requirement. If the weapon has the burst, penetrating, or rapid property, you must meet the Strength requirement to use this feature. If the weapon lacks the two-handed property, you can wield the weapon in two hands to temporarily reduce the strength number by one step (from 19 to 17, 17 to 15, 15 to 13, or 13 to 11). If this would reduce the strength number below 11, you ignore it entirely.</p>
