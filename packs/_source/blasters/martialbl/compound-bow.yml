      <h3>Mighty</h3>
      <p>When making an attack with a mighty weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</p>
      <h3>Silent</h3>
      <p>When you make a ranged weapon attack with a weapon with the silent property while hidden, it does not automatically reveal your presence. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check contested by your targets' Wisdom (Perception) check. On a success, you remain hidden.</p>
      <h3>Special (range 75/300)</h3>
      <p>A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has this property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</p>
      <h3>Two-handed</h3>
      <p>A weapon with this property requires two hands to use.</p><h3>Description</h3>
      <p>Rather than traditional power cells, the compound bow fires specialized projectiles in the form of arrows. You can make a ranged weapon attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one arrow. </p>
      <p>Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</p>
