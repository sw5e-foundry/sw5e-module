      "value": "<h3>Brutal</h3>\n<p>When you score a critical hit with a weapon with the brutal property, you roll a number of additional weapon damage dice equal to the brutal number.</p>\n<h3>Keen 1</h3>\n<p>When you make a weapon attack with a weapon with the keen property, the critical hit range increases by an amount equal to the keen number.</p>\n<h3>Reload 4</h3>\n<p>A number of shots equal to the reload number can be made with a weapon with this property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (their choice). You must have one free hand to reload.</p>\n<h3>Special (range 120/480)</h3>\n<p>A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has this property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</p>\n<h3>Strength 19</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property has a heavy kickback. While wielding it, you have disadvantage on attack rolls unless you meet the Strength requirement. If the weapon has the burst, penetrating, or rapid property, you must meet the Strength requirement to use this feature. If the weapon lacks the two-handed property, you can wield the weapon in two hands to temporarily reduce the strength number by one step (from 19 to 17, 17 to 15, 15 to 13, or 13 to 11). If this would reduce the strength number below 11, you ignore it entirely.</p>\n<h3>Two-handed</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property requires two hands to use.</p><h3>Description</h3>\n<p>Before firing the sentry gun, you must deploy it using an action unless you meet its strength requirement. Alternatively, if you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this action replaces one of them.  While deployed in this way, you treat this weapon's strength number as two steps less (from 19 to 15), your speed is reduced by half, and you cannot fire this weapon at long range. You can collapse the sentry gun as an action or bonus action.</p>",
