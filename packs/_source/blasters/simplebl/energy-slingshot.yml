      <h3>Power cell (range 20/80) Cell</h3>
      <p>Weapons with this property are fueled by power cells, which must be loaded in order to fire the weapon. A power cell fuels a number of attacks equal to the weapon's reload number.</p>
      <h3>Disruptive</h3>
      <p>When a creature is forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration due to taking damage from a weapon with the disruptive property, the DC for the check equals 10 or the full damage taken, whichever number is higher, instead of only half.</p>
      <h3>Fixed</h3>
      <p>A weapon with this property does not fill the hand, but you can't use the weapon while the hand is full. Additionally, you have a +10 bonus to ability checks and saving throws to avoid being disarmed of this weapon.</p>
      <h3>Mighty</h3>
      <p>When making an attack with a mighty weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</p>
      <h3>Reload 20</h3>
      <p>A number of shots equal to the reload number can be made with a weapon with this property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (their choice). You must have one free hand to reload.</p>
      <h3>Two-handed</h3>
      <p>A weapon with this property requires two hands to use.</p>
