If the weapon has the burst, penetrating, or rapid property, you must meet the Strength requirement to use this feature. If the weapon lacks the two-handed property, you can wield the weapon in two hands to temporarily reduce the strength number by one step (from 19 to 17, 17 to 15, 15 to 13, or 13 to 11). If this would reduce the strength number below 11, you ignore it entirely.</p>"
