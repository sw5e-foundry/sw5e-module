      <p>Aleena are short, reptilian bipeds with large eyes and wide mouths full of small, sharp teeth. Aleena's bodies are long compared to their short arms and stubby legs. Warm-blooded reptiles, they possess exceptional reflexes as well as a fast metabolism which allow them to convert food into energy very rapidly in order to escape predators on their harsh home planet. </p>
      <h2>Society and Culture</h2>

Due to their inborn curiosity, the aleena are stereotypically galactic travelers, tourists in every sense.

The appearance of aleena family walking through an intergalactic metropolis is a common sight on many planets. The aleena's love of sports and particularly, adventure and thrill sports, draw many into the galactic community. Most who enter professional classes are experts or diplomats. </p>

The leader of each tahiko led the community, and represented their wishes to the planetary advisory body. The advisory body elected a king to govern the planet, and was generally revered as a religious figure as they led religious ceremonies. </p>
