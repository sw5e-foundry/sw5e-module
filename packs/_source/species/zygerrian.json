      "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>The Zygerrians are a bipedal, sentient humanoid species. Feline in appearance, the species possesses strong, angular features, with long fangs jutting from their jaws and claws extending from their hands. The Zygerrians' faces and their pointed ears are almost entirely covered with fur; males usually have more hair than females, with bands of fur growing on their cheeks. Male Zygerrians also display a number of bony spurs protruding from the chin, which females typically lack. Zygerrians usually have sallow complexions and are physically strong, but some suffer from obesity. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>A warlike species, the Zygerrians hold strength—both physical and mental—in great esteem, viewing it as a means to gain power and authority. They believe that it is the natural order of life for the strong to dominate the weak, so slavery is normal for the species, and a display of weakness could mean death or enslavement in their culture. Those who become their slaves are viewed as inferior by the Zygerrians.</p>\n<p>Zygerrian society is organized into clans and classes. They have a noble class, many members of which, despite their high status, pursue a career in the military. The Zygerrian government is a monarchy; female rulers hold the title of Queen, and males are addressed as Kings.</p>\n<p>The center of the Zygerrian society is the Zygerrian Slavers Guild, which focuses on the slave trade in the Outer Rim Territories. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Zygerrian names are rather diverse, though shorter names are the most common. Surnames are familial.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Agruss, Darts, Atai, Sono</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Miraj, Faralhi, Latrans, MaDall</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> D'nar, Molec, Scientel, Thanda, Tyne</p>",
