      <h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>
      <p>Sith are a proud and violent species of humanoids that evolved on Korriban, a planet within the Horuset system in an isolated Outer Rim region called the Stygian Caldera. Sith have a larger than average number of individuals with potential to use the Force in their species, so high in fact that the entire species was considered strongly Force-sensitive. </p>
      <p>Sith purebloods are characterized by their expressive facial appendages, bone spurs, cranial horns, and predatory gaze.</p>
      <h2>Society and Culture</h2>
      <p>Sith culture is a rigid and stratified caste-based society. For the sith, war and violence are just as much a part of the natural order of life as peace or serenity. Though they are in an almost constant state of war, their civilization is quite sophisticated; they see these acts not as cruel or barbaric, but simply basic aspects of existence. Their constant warring led to a dwindling of the population on their original homeworld of Korriban as well as cultivated an intensely xenophobic society. </p>
      <h2>Names</h2>
      <p>Sith pureblood names are not conventional. They are often named for virtues in the Sith tongue. Sith rarely share surnames, since they do not value family ties. When a sith pureblood achieves a success or victory, they often change their name to match their perceived newfound status. Since Force-sensitivity is common in sith purebloods, and their culture is built around strength, most sith are called simply "My Lord," or some other epithet, by their underlings.</p>
