      <h2>Biology and Appearence</h2>
      <p>Togruta have rusty skin tones ranging in hue from blue to red to green, with white pigmentation on their faces, greyish lips, and white stripes adorn various parts of their bodies. The pattern of stripes varies from individual to individual. This red and white pattern was a phenotype left over from their ancestor's camouflage that helped them to blend in with Shili's natural surroundings.</p>
      <p>Their heads bear two montrals, with three to four head-tails, whose stripes were darker than those of the montrals. Togruta have the ability to sense the proximity and movement of physical objects around them by means of their hollow montrals, which detect space ultrasonically. Young togrutas' montrals and posterior head-tail do not fully grow until adolescence, when their montrals curve and their final head-tail grows to the length of their other head-tails.</p>
      <h2>Society and Culture</h2>
      <p>Togruta have a strong sense of unity and togetherness. On their native homeworld of Shili, they rely on each other and  band together to take a stand against the massive monsters that hunt them. The creatures of Shili most often attack in groups, which was even more reason for the native togruta to work together. While most of Shili is covered in the scrublands where the togruta hunt their herbivorous prey, the togruta live in small communities in the forest valleys.</p>
