      <p>You are skilled in the art of fighting with a single weapon. You gain the following benefits:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>While you are wielding a weapon in one hand with which you are proficient and no other weapons, you can use your bonus action to feint. If you do so, you must make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or Charisma (Deception) check (your choice) contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. On a success, you have advantage on the first attack roll you make against them before the start of your next turn.</li>
      <li>While you are wielding a weapon in one hand with which you are proficient and no other weapons, when you miss with a weapon attack on your turn, you can use your bonus action to repeat the attack against the same target. Any modifications to the original attack roll, such as advantage, disadvantage, or without your proficiency bonus, also affect this attack roll.</li>
      <li>Once on each of your turns, drawing or stowing a one-handed weapon no longer requires your object interaction.</li></ul>
