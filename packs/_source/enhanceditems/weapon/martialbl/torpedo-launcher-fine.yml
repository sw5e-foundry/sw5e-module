    value: "<h4>Weapon (Torpedo Launcher)</h4>\n <p>You have a +1 bonus to attack rolls made with this enhanced weapon. Additionally, the damage of torpedoes fired by this weapon increases by one step (from [[/r d4]] to [[/r d6]], [[/r d6]] to [[/r d8]], [[/r d8]] to [[/r d10]], [[/r d10]] to [[/r d12]], or [[/r d12]] to [[/r d20]]). If this would increase the damage die above a [[/r d20]], instead add an additional five dice to the torpedo's damage for each step above a [[/r d20]].</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<h2>Torpedo launcher</h2>\n<h3>Special (range 1200/3600)</h3>\n<p>A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has this property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</p>\n<h3>Reload 1</h3>\n<p>A number of shots equal to the reload number can be made with a weapon with this property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (their choice). You must have one free hand to reload.</p>\n<h3>Two-handed</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property requires two hands to use.</p><h3>Description</h3>\n<p>Rather than traditional power cells, the torpedo launcher fires specialized projectiles in the form of torpedoes. Torpedo launchers have advantage on attack rolls against Gargantuan creatures and disadvantage on attack rolls against Large and smaller creatures. Unlike other weapons, the torpedo launcher can only be loaded using an action, and you don't add your Dexterity modifier to damage rolls you make with it.</p>\n<p>The torpedo launcher requires the use of a tripod, which is included in the price. Over the course of 1 minute, you can deploy or collapse the torpedo launcher on the tripod. While deployed, your speed is reduced to 0.</p>"
