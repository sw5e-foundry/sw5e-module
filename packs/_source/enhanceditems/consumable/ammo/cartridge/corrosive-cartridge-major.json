This bonus is in addition to any bonuses granted by the weapon. Once the corrosive cartridge has been fired, it no longer gives a bonus. Additionally, when you hit with a shot with the loaded weapon, the creature must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking [[/r 1d8]] acid damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with the loaded weapon, it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it dies immediately without making death saving throws. A disintegrated creature and everything unenhanced it is wearing and carrying are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. A creature destroyed in this way can not be revitalized.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h2>Corrosive cartridge</h2>\n<p>A corrosive cartridge is a specialized slug cartridge for use with blaster weapons that deal kinetic damage.
