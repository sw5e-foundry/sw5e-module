    value: "<h4>Consumable (Ammunition)</h4>\n <p>You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this wrist launcher dart, which deals [[/r 1d6]] kinetic damage on a hit. This bonus is in addition to any bonuses granted by the weapon. Once the dart has been fired, it no longer gives a bonus. Also on a hit, the creature must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw, taking [[/r 1d6]] psychic damage on a failed save. </p>\n<p>Additionally, on a failed save, a creature becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. At the start of an affected creature's turn, it can repeat this save, ending the effect on a success.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<h2>Panic dart</h2>\n<p>This wrist launcher ammunition deals [[/r 1d6]] kinetic damage on a hit.
