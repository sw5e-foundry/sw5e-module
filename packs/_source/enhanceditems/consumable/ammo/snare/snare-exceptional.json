A snare has no effect on formless or Large or larger creatures. A creature can use its action to make a DC 18 Strength or Dexterity check (the target chooses the ability to use), freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The snare has an AC of 14, 25 hit points, immunity to all damage not dealt by melee weapons, and resistance to damage dealt by unenhanced melee weapons.
