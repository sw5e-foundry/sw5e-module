    value: "<h4>Consumable (Explosive)</h4>\n <p>Mines can be set to detonate when a creature comes within up to 15 feet of it or paired with a remote detonator. As an action, you can prime and set a mine on a surface you can reach, which arms at the start of your next turn. When detonated, the mine fills the air in a 15-foot-radius sphere with yellow-green fog for 1 minute. The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a wind of at least 10 miles per hour disperses it.</p>\n<p>When a creature enters the fog or starts its turn there, it creature must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. The creature takes [[/r 6d6]] poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, on a failed save, the creature is poisoned while it is in the cloud. Droids, constructs and humanoids wearing appropriate protective equipment are unaffected.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<h2>Mine, gas</h2>\n<p>Mines can be set to detonate when a creature comes within up to 15 feet of it or paired with a remote </p>"
