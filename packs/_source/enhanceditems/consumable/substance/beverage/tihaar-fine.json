For the next minute, the creature experiences a high that allows them to roll an additional [[/r d3]] when making an ability check or saving throw using Constitution, and at the start of each of the creature's turns it gains [[/r 2d3]] temporary hit points. At the end of the high, the creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or experience a low that lasts 10 minutes, during which they must roll a [[/r d3]] and subtract the result when making an ability check or saving throw using Constitution, and for the duration their current and maximum hit points are reduced by [[/r 2d3]]. If this would reduce your maximum hit points below 1, it instead becomes 1. At the end of the low, the creature must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw to resist addiction.</p>"
