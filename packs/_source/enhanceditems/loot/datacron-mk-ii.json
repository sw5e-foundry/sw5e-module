On a success, they learn the contained tech power, which does not count against their tech powers known. On a failure, the power is not learned and the techcaster can't try again for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><em>Datacrons are encrypted storage devices that contain an interactive projection, and are used to store high-value, sensitive information.</em></p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<h2>Datacron</h2>\n<p>A datacron is a type of holocron that can be accessed by non-Force-sensitives and are mainly used to store encrypted data.
