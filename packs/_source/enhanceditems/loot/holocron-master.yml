    value: "<h4>Adventuring Gear</h4>\n <p>This holocron contains a single 7th-level force power, or multiple powers of 1st-6th level with a combined level no greater than 7. After meditating with the holocron for at least 40 hours, a forcecaster with a Max Power Level of 7th or higher can make a DC 26 forcecasting ability check with proficiency based on the alignment of the power(s) stored within. On a success, they learn the contained force power(s), which does not count against their force powers known and can not be unlearned except through use of a <em>remove curse</em> power. On a failure, the power is not learned and the forcecaster can't try again for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><em>Holocrons are information-storage devices used by Force-wielders that contain ancient lessons or valuable information in holographic form.</em></p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<h2>Holocron</h2>\n<p>Holocrons are information-storage devices used by force wielders that contain ancient lessons or valuable information in holographic form. They appear as palm-sized, glowing polyhedrons of crystalline material and hardware, and can only be activated and used through the power of the Force.</p>"
