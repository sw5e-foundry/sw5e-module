    value: "<h4>Adventuring Gear</h4>\n <p>This datacron contains a single 7th-level tech power, or multiple powers of 1st-6th level with a combined level no greater than 7. After tinkering with the datacron for at least 40 hours, a techcaster with a Max Power Level of 7th or higher can make a DC 26 techcasting ability check with proficiency. On a success, they learn the contained tech power(s), which does not count against their tech powers known. On a failure, the power is not learned and the techcaster can't try again for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><em>Datacrons are encrypted storage devices that contain an interactive projection, and are used to store high-value, sensitive information.</em></p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<h2>Datacron</h2>\n<p>A datacron is a type of holocron that can be accessed by non-Force-sensitives and are mainly used to store encrypted data.
