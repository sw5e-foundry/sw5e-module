    value: "<h4>Adventuring Gear</h4>\n <p>Binders can be used to restrain a Small or Medium creature with appropriate appendages. Applying binders takes an action, and the target must make a DC 18 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (the target chooses the ability to use). A hostile creature makes this save with advantage. A set of binders comes with one key. Breaking the binders requires a DC 24 Strength check. Escaping them requires a DC 24 Dexterity check. Without the key, unlocking the binders requires a DC 21 security kit to force open. Binders have an AC of 12 and 45 hit points. Destroying the binders frees the creature without harming it.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<h2>Binders</h2>\n<p>Binders can be used to restrain a Small or Medium creature with appropriate appendages.
