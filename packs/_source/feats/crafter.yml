      <p>You have a knack for crafting; you work with greater efficiency and produce goods of higher quality. Select one type of artisan's implements. You gain the following benefits:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>
      <li>You gain proficiency with the chosen tool. If you are already proficient with it, you instead gain expertise with it.</li>
      <li>When you craft something with the chosen tool, the total market value you can craft increases 50 cr per day. If you have expertise with it, the market value instead increases by 100 cr per day.</li>
      <li>If you use the tool you've selected to practice a profession during downtime, you can support a lifestyle one higher than you would normally be able to.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose a different set of artisan's implements. </p>
