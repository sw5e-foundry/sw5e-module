      <p>You learn how to effectively read and track your prey. Once on each of your turns, you can choose a creature you can see within 120 feet and mark it as your quarry (no action required). For the next hour, you gain the following benefits:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Once per turn, when you hit the target with a weapon attack, you can deal [[/r 1d4]] additional damage to it of the same type as the weapon's damage. </li>
      <li>You have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check you make to find it while it's on the same planet as you.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can only have one creature marked in this way at a time. You can mark creatures in this way a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus, rounded up. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>
