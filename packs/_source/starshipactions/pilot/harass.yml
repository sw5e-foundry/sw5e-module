  description:
    value: <p><span style="font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif">You can harass an enemy and lock them into a series of close-combat maneuvers in order to prevent their escape. When you take the harass action, make an opposed Dexterity (Maneuvering) check against a target within one size category of you and within normal range of at least one of your forward facing primary weapons. This weapon cannot be Fired this turn. On a success, if the target voluntarily leaves it's square before the beginning of your next turn, it takes damage as though it suffered a critical hit with the primary weapon used to harass.</span></p>
